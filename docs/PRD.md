# cherry-in-the-haystack - Product Requirements Document

**Author:** HK
**Date:** 2025-11-07
**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

**cherry-in-the-haystack** evolves from a personal content curation tool into **The LLM Engineering Handbook** — a living, community-driven knowledge base that serves as the default reference for anyone building with AI products.

The product addresses the critical problem of fragmented, rapidly-changing LLM knowledge that overwhelms practitioners. Engineers, builders, and product teams currently rely on scattered Twitter posts, Discord chats, papers, repos, and blog updates that become outdated within weeks. There is no single, living source of truth that organizes this knowledge and helps people make practical decisions when building real AI products.

**The LLM Engineering Handbook provides:**
- Continuously updated, structured map of what matters right now
- Clear explanations, trade-offs, and practical examples
- Collective intelligence that compounds instead of fading
- Orientation in a chaotic, fast-moving landscape

### What Makes This Special

**"Orientation in chaos through collective intelligence that compounds."**

This isn't just documentation — it's a living knowledge base sustained by a community of active practitioners that becomes more valuable every week. The magic happens when someone realizes:

> *"This isn't just information — it's the exact distillation of what I needed, at the right level, and up-to-date."*

**The "Wow" Moments:**
- A founder reads "Choosing your embedding model" and instantly knows the trade-offs for their use case
- An engineer finds a clean, minimal reference architecture for retrieval or agent orchestration that just clicks
- A newcomer sees they can follow the map instead of drowning in noise
- Users experience: **Clarity** ("Ah, now I understand"), **Confidence** ("I know which approach to choose"), and **Speed** ("I caught up in minutes, not days")

## Project Classification

**Technical Type:** Web Application + API Backend (Hybrid)
**Domain:** EdTech / Knowledge Management
**Complexity:** Medium

### Architecture Evolution

The product builds on the existing Auto-News infrastructure, transforming it from a personal curation tool into a multi-stage, human-in-the-loop knowledge synthesis platform:

**Current Architecture:** Auto-News (Personal Content Aggregation)
- Event-driven data pipeline with Apache Airflow
- LLM-powered categorization, ranking, summarization
- Output to Notion workspaces

**New Architecture:** The LLM Engineering Handbook Platform

- Zero infrastructure overhead for hosting
- Fast, SEO-friendly static pages
- Focus on content pipeline automation rather than web development

- Endpoints:
  - `GET /api/sections` - List all sections
  - `GET /api/sections/{section}/topics` - Topics in section
  - `GET /api/topics/{topic}` - Topic content
  - `GET /api/search?q=query` - Search content

**Contribution API:**

## Product Magic Summary

**The LLM Engineering Handbook delivers "orientation in chaos" through:**

🌟 **Comprehensive Coverage** - Auto-News aggregates from 10+ sources so users don't have to monitor dozens of channels

🌟 **Intelligent Curation** - AI scoring + human review filters 80% noise, surfacing only top-tier insights

🌟 **MECE Knowledge Structure** - Logical navigation without gaps or overlaps makes users say "now I understand"

🌟 **Living Updates** - Weekly "Newly Discovered" content keeps the handbook feeling alive and current

🌟 **Community Intelligence** - 20+ contributors make collective knowledge compound instead of fade

🌟 **Clarity, Confidence, Speed** - Users consistently report: "This is exactly what I needed, at the right level, up-to-date"

**The "wow" moment:** When someone realizes they can follow the map instead of drowning in noise - finding the exact distillation they needed, saving days of research.

**Future vision:** Evolves into "GitHub for Personal Knowledge Management" where everyone maintains knowledge repos and syncs with the community through AI-powered collaboration.
